## Classification of equivalent mutants

A sample of some of the tested techniques. [[SPC-plugin_mutate_references]]
Quote from 2, p.8-9:

*Based on the work of constraint test data generation, Offutt and Pan [186],
[187], [197] introduced a new equivalent mutant detection approach using
constraint solving. In their approach, the equivalent mutant problem is
formulated as a constraint satisfaction problem by analysing the path condition
of a mutant. A mutant is equivalent if and only if the input constraint is
unsat- isfiable. Empirical evaluation of a prototype has shown that this
technique is able to detect a significant percentage of equivalent mutants
(47.63% among 11 subject programs) for most of the programs. Their results
suggest that the constraint satisfaction formulation is more powerful than the
compiler optimization technique [178].*
